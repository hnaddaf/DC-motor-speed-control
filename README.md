# DC-motor-speed-control
This project demonstrates how to control the speed of a 12V brushless DC motor using a PID controller implemented on an Arduino Uno.The speed control is achieved through a feedback loop where the actual motor speed is measured using an encoder and compared with the desired speed. The PID algorithm then adjusts the motor input voltage to minimize the speed error.
